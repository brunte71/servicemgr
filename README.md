## SQLite Storage Overview

The app stores operational data in `data/mymaintlog.db` (SQLite, WAL mode).

Main tables:
- `objects`: equipment/facilities/other tracked objects
- `services`: planned and scheduled services
- `reminders`: due-date reminders and notification flags
- `reports`: completed service reports
- `fault_reports`: fault observations and metadata
- `meter_units`: allowed unit values
- `fault_photos`: image blobs for fault reports

   ```

3. **Run the application**

### Customization

### Adding New Object Types

Edit `utils/data_handler.py`:
```python
OBJECT_TYPES = ["Vehicle", "Facility", "Other"]
```

Then create a new page file: `pages/X_YourNewType.py`

### Modifying Service Intervals

Service intervals are customizable per service. Set any number of days when creating/editing a service.

### Report Types

Current report types are: Maintenance, Inspection, Repair, Preventive, Other

To add more types, modify the selectbox options in `pages/6_Service_Reports.py`

Your data is stored in the SQLite database in the `data/` folder. To backup:

1. Copy the entire `data/` folder to a safe location
2. Or use the export buttons on the Dashboard
3. Or manually backup `data/mymaintlog.db`

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: SQLite database file not created automatically
- **Solution**: Create the `data/` folder manually if it doesn't exist and verify write permissions

**Problem**: Data not persisting
- **Solution**: Ensure the `data/` folder has write permissions

**Problem**: Filters not working
- **Solution**: Make sure you have data in the system first
